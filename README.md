# ffmpeg

Nothing but ffmpeg. Installed on the debian:wheezy base image from the default repositories.

Please note that this is a **really** old version of ffmpeg because the Debian maintainers stopped providing new builds a while ago. I would suggest using [nachochip's](https://hub.docker.com/r/nachochip/ffmpeg/) image instead.
